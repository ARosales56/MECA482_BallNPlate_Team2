## 1. Introduction 

A controller for a ball and plate system that is being designed by matlab, simulink, and coppelia. The system is to keep a ball balanced at the center of the plate and must react accroding to the balls position to avoid the ball falling from the plate.

## 2. System Requirements

The System requirements are the parameters for our system it consisting of
